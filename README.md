The qualitative comparsion between UPT, Our method without the proposed Far-Near Distance Attention (Ours wo FNDA) and Our method (Ours). 
From (a) to (i), the human-object center distance increase monotonically.
It can be observed that when the human-object are close to each other (a ~ e), our method assigns similar or slightly lower scores for the indicated interations.
Nonetheless, when the human-object are far away from each other (f ~ i), our method assigns apparently higher scores to the indicated interactions, suggesting that our method is able to better capture distant interactions.
Note that only part of interactions in the image are indicated.
