The qualitative comparsion between UPT, Our method without the proposed Far-Near Distance Attention (Ours wo FNDA) and Our method (Ours). 
From (a) to (i), the human-object center distance monitically increases.
It can be observed that when the human-object are close to each other (a ~ e), our method assigns similar or slightly lower scores for the marked interations compared to baseline UPT.
Nonetheless, when the human-object are far away from each other (f ~ i), our method assigns higher scores to the given interaction, suggesting that our method is able to better model distant interactions.
Note that only part of the interactions in an image are illustrated.
