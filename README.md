The qualitative comparsion between UPT, Ours method without the proposed Far-Near Distance Attention and Our method (Ours). 
From (a) to (i), the human-object center distance increase monotonically.
It can be observed that when the human-object are close to each other (a ~ e), our method achieves similar or slightly lower scores for the indicated interations.
While when the human-object are far away from each other (f ~ i), our method assigns higher scores to the indicated interactions, suggesting that our method is able to better capture distant interactions.
